3️⃣ Action Center (Most Important Section)

This is where your dashboard becomes useful, not decorative.

🔔 “My Actions” Panel

Show only user-specific tasks, for example:

Approve leave (if manager)

Upload missing document

Complete KYC

Accept policy acknowledgment

Fill feedback / survey

Rule:
If no actions → show

“You’re all caught up 🎉”



4️⃣ Quick Actions (Buttons, Not Menus)

These should be big, obvious, and fast.

Suggested buttons:

➕ Apply Leave

⏱️ Regularize Attendance

📄 Download Payslip

📝 Update Profile

🎫 Raise Request / Ticket

👉 This avoids users digging through menus.



5️⃣ Personal Information Summary (Read-Only)

This reassures employees that their data exists & is correct.

Show only non-sensitive info:

Employee ID

Department

Reporting Manager

Location

DOJ

Add a small link:

✏️ Request change


7️⃣ Calendar Snapshot (Optional but Powerful)

Mini calendar showing:

Applied leaves

Holidays

Birthdays (optional)

Company events

This improves engagement without forcing navigation.
